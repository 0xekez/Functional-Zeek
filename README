Functional-Zeek
===============
A collection of Zeek scripts to demonstrate the power of 
Zeek's functions.

* basics.zeek demonstrates some (you guessed it) basic 
  operations.

* matrix_ops.zeek demonstrates the process of transforming
  a vector with a function.

* point.zeek is a point class written entirely with Zeek 
  functions.
